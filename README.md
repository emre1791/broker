# Broker

A broker that lets your **Node.js**, **Roblox Studio**, and **Roblox game servers/clients** talk to each other—cleanly and in real time.

## Repository layout

* **/daemon** – the broker service
* **/node-agent** – Node.js client library
* **/roblox-agent** – Roblox client library
* **/examples** – samples
* **/scripts** – helper utilities

> Daemon can run in a cloud, or same node program you use node-agent in.

## Roadmap (short)

* Better docs and examples
* Typed SDKs & quality‑of‑life utilities
* CLI for quick pub/sub and inspection

## Contributing

PRs welcome. A lightweight CONTRIBUTING guide and Code of Conduct will land soon.
